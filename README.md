## Identification of novel genes for Adams-Oliver syndrome using regulatory elements
### A collection of Figures created within RStudio (v2025.09.0+387) as part of a final year Masters dissertation.

Adams-Oliver Syndrome (AOS) is a rare congential disease affecting 1 in 225,000 live births. While six genes have been established as causative, 70% of patient cohorts remain genetically unsolved highlighting a high missing heritablility. This project aimed to identify novel candidate genes by bioinformatically investigating whole exome sequencing data of several AOS affected individuals.
